* **General**
    * **Enabled** - Option to enable or disable the module.
      :::info
      When this option is disabled, the module will not run, but can remain installed and configured.

      This option is useful for temporarily disabling the module without losing the configuration, or for maintenance
      purposes.
      :::

    * **Poll Rate in Minutes** - Option to configure the poll rate for historical data via DataMailbox
      :::info
      This option allows for the configuration of how often the module polls for historical data via DataMailbox.

      The default value is 1 minute, but this can be increased (in minute intervals) to reduce DataMailbox usage.
      :::

    * **Realtime Poll Rate in Seconds** - Option to configure the poll rate for realtime data via M2Web (where
      applicable)
      :::info
      This option allows for the configuration of how often the module polls for realtime data from an Ewon via M2Web.

      The default value is 10 seconds, but this can be increased or decreased (in second intervals) to reduce Ewon and
      M2Web usage.
      :::

    * **Metadata Update Rate in Minutes** - Option to configure the poll rate for Ewon/tag metadata updates
      :::info
      This option allows for the configuration of how often the module polls for Ewon/tag metadata. This includes
      new Ewon devices, new tags, and updated tag metadata such as descriptions and data types.

      The default value is 30 minutes, but this can be increased or decreased (in minute intervals) to reduce
      Ewon and M2Web usage.

      Regardless of the value configured, the module will perform an initial metadata update upon startup.
      Until this initial metadata update is complete, the module will not poll for tag data.

      Talk2M developer IDs must be requested from HMS.
      If you do not have a Talk2M Developer ID, you may request one
      here: [https://developer.ewon.biz/registration](https://developer.ewon.biz/registration).
      :::

* **Ewon Device Information**
    * **Ewon Username** - Option to configure the Ewon device username to use for the module
      :::info
      This option allows for the configuration of the Ewon device username which will be used for the module. This
      username must be identical for all linked Ewons.

      All linked Ewons must have at least one common user account to enable realtime and write functionality via M2Web.
      The username and password can be any valid combination, but must be consistent across all linked Ewons.
      :::

    * **Change Password?** - Option to enable the password field for the Ewon device
      :::info

      :::

    * **Ewon Password** - Option to configure the Ewon device password to use for the module
      :::info
      This option allows for the configuration of the Ewon device password which will be used for the module.
      This field is disabled by default to prevent unexpected or accidental password changes, and must be enabled
      by selecting the `Change Password?` option above. This password must be identical for all linked Ewons.

      All linked Ewons must have at least one common user account to enable realtime and write functionality via M2Web.
      The username and password can be any valid combination, but must be consistent across all linked Ewons.
      :::


* **History**
    * **History Enabled** - Option to enable DataMailbox historical data logging to a history provider.
      :::info
      When this option is enabled, the connector will log historical data to the history provider specified in the
      `Target History Provider` field.

      When this option is disabled, the connector will only log historical data to the tag provider.
      :::

    * **Target History Provider** - Option to select the history provider to log historical data to.
      :::info
      When the `History Enabled` option is enabled, the connector will log historical data to the history provider
      specified in this field.
      :::

* **Advanced**
    * **Debug Enabled** - Option to enable debug logging.
      :::info
      When this option is enabled, the connector will log additional information to the Ignition console.
      This option is useful for troubleshooting, and includes information such as:
        * HTTP request IDs and status updates (i.e., HTTP request started, HTTP request finished)
        * Consistent warning logs (i.e., offline Ewon warnings not suppressed after the first warning)
        * General connector state information (i.e., start and finish of polling cycles)

      Unless you are troubleshooting, it is recommended to leave this option disabled.
      Debug logging may impact performance.
      :::

    * **Combine Live Data:** Option to combine live data with historical data.
      :::info
      When this option is enabled, tags that are read in realtime will be combined with historical data, if available.
      This option has no effect when the `Read all values in realtime` option is enabled.

      The connector will only combine historical data with realtime data if the historical data was already read from
      DataMailbox.
      For example, when some tags (not all) are configured to be read in realtime, a DataMailbox transaction will be
      performed to read the historical data for the tags that are not configured to be read in realtime.
      If historical data is also included for the tags that are read in realtime, the
      connector will combine that historical data with the realtime data
      (instead of omitting the historical data).
      :::

    * **Read all values in realtime** - Option to always read all tag values in realtime.
      :::info
      When this option is enabled, all tags will be read in realtime.

      This option disables DataMailbox reads.
      Historical values logged on the Ewon will not be logged in Ignition.
      :::

    * **Tag Write Buffer Length (ms)** - Option to configure tag write buffering (and the associated buffer length).
      :::info
      When this option is configured to -1 or any value below the minimum of 100, tag write buffering is not enabled,
      and tag writes are sent to the Ewon immediately.
      When this option is configured to a value above the minimum of 100, tag writes will be buffered for the specified
      length of time before sending them to the Ewon.

      Each time a tag is written, it is added to a buffer.
      If it is the first tag in the buffer, a timer is started.
      Otherwise, it is added to the existing buffer.
      When the buffer length timer has elapsed, all buffered tag writes are sent to each Ewon in a single request.
      :::

    * **Sort Tags by Group** - Option to enable tag sorting by group.
      :::info
      When this option is enabled, tags are sorted into folders for each Ewon, based on their tag groups.

      For each Ewon, a folder is created for each tag group combination and tags are placed in their respective group
      folder.
      If a tag is not in a group, it is placed in the root Ewon tag folder.
      If a tag is in multiple groups, it is placed in the folder with a name that is the concatenation of all groups.
      For example, if a tag is in the groups `A` and `C`, it will be placed in the folder `AC`.
      :::

    * **Disable Tag Name Checking** - Option to disable tag name checking.
      :::info
      When this option is enabled, tag names are not checked for invalid characters.

      By default, tag names are checked for invalid characters.
      If a tag name contains an invalid character, it is replaced with an underscore (`_`).
