<>The {ScDocusaurusConfig.title} has been designed to take advantage of the Ignition server's available hardware
resources. Multi-threading and asynchronous processing allow the connector to simultaneously handle multiple requests at
a time. </><br/>

#### Minimum Hardware Requirements

CPU: 2 cores<br/>
RAM: 4 GB<br/>

:::caution

The minimum hardware requirements are suitable for a small number of devices and tags. If you are planning to connect
many devices or tags, you should consider increasing the hardware resources available to Ignition and its modules.

These requirements match those of Ignition, with additional memory (RAM) required for the connector to run.

:::

#### Recommended Hardware Requirements

CPU: 4 cores<br/>
RAM: 8 GB<br/>

:::tip

The recommended hardware requirements are suitable for most installations. If you are planning to connect a large number
devices and/or tags, you should consider increasing the hardware resources available to Ignition and its modules.

There is no upper limit on the number of devices and tags that can be connected to the connector, but the hardware
resources available to Ignition will limit the number of devices and tags that can be connected. If you experience
a degradation in performance, it is recommended to increase the hardware resources available to Ignition and its
modules. This may include increasing the number of CPU cores, increasing the amount of RAM, or increasing the amount of
storage space available to Ignition.
