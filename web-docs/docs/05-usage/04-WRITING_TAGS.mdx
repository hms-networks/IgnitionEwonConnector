# Ignition EwonÂ® Connector Module - Writing Tags

### Writing Values

Ewon tag values can be written from Ignition. When attempting to write a tag value, be sure that the the communication
mode is set to `Comm Read/Write` in the Ignition Designer `Project` menu.

The `Tag Browser` tool in Ignition Designer can be used to write tag values.

After a tag value is written in Ignition, the displayed value my revert back to its previous state. This is because new
DataMailbox values were received. DataMailbox values will always lag the live tag value. This behavior can be avoided by
temporarily enabling realtime mode for the tag/Ewon being written to.
