The Ewon Flexy tags synchronized by the connector must adhere to the following rules.

By default, and with the `Disable Tag Name Checking` option unselected, tags must begin with an alphanumeric or
underscore. Additional characters must be an alphanumeric, underscore, space, or any of the following: `' - : ( )`.

If the `Disable Tag Name Checking` option is unselected, the connector will attempt to convert any illegal characters
in tag names to underscores.
