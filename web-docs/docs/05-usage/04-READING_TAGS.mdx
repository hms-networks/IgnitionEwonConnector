### Realtime (Live) Values

Realtime (live) tag data functionality is supported by the connector, allowing for the reading of tag values in
realtime. This functionality may be enabled connector-wide, per Ewon Flexy, or per tag.

#### Connector-Wide

To enable realtime (live) tag data functionality connector-wide, set the `Read all values in realtime` field to `true`
in the connector configuration.

1. From the Ignition Gateway webpage, navigate to the `Config` section.
2. Select the `Ewon Connector` option from the left-hand menu.
3. Enable the `Read all values in realtime` option.
4. Click the `Save Changes` button, then restart Ignition.

#### Per Ewon Flexy

To enable realtime (live) tag data functionality per Ewon Flexy, set the `_STATUS/ForceRealtimeData` tag to `true` in
each Ewon Flexy's tag folder.

1. From the Ignition Designer, navigate to the `Tag Browser` tool.
2. Expand the `All Providers` directory.
3. Expand the `Ewon` directory (associated with the Ewon Connector).
4. Expand the Ewon Flexy's directory.
5. Expand the `_STATUS` tag folder.
6. Set the `_STATUS/ForceRealtimeData` tag to `true`.

:::note

If you are not in read/write mode, you will need to switch to read/write mode to set the tag value.

#### Per Tag

To enable realtime (live) tag data functionality per tag, set the `ForceRealtimeData` property to `true` in the tag's
properties.

1. From the Ignition Designer, navigate to the `Tag Browser` tool.
2. Expand the `All Providers` directory.
3. Expand the `Ewon` directory (associated with the Ewon Connector).
4. Expand the Ewon Flexy's directory.
5. Select the tag and expand it to view its properties.
