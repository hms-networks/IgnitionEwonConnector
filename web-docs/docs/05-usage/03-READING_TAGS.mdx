# Ignition EwonÂ® Connector Module - Reading Tags

### Reading Values

The tags created by the connector are native Ignition tags and are updated cyclically by the connector based on the
polling rates set during the [Setup](#setup) step.

The `Tag Browser` tool in Ignition Designer can be used to read tag values.

### Realtime Values

The realtime value functionality allows Ignition to read live tag values from an Ewon up to once per second.

This functionality can be enabled in three ways.

**1. Individual Tag**

* Open Designer and navigate to the `Tag Browser`
* Expand the `All Providers` directory.
* Expand the directory associated with your Ewon Connector Tag Provider.
* Expand the directory associated with the Ewon you want to read a live tag value from.
* Expand the tag name to show the tag's properties.
* Find the `Realtime` property and enable it.

**2. Individual Ewon**

* Open Designer and navigate to the `Tag Browser`
* Expand the `All Providers` directory.
* Expand the directory associated with your Ewon Connector Tag Provider.
* Expand the directory associated with the Ewon you want to read live tag values from.
* Expand the `_config` directory.
* Find the `AllRealtime` tag and enable it.

**3. All Ewons**

* Navigate to the Ewon Connector Configuration webpage discussed in the [Setup](#setup) section.
* Enable the `Read all values in realtime` option.
* Click `Save Changes`, then restart Ignition.

_Note: The realtime functionality counts against your Talk2M account's monthly bandwidth._
