## Version 2.0.0
This version of the module is a near-complete rewrite to bring new features, improved performance, and support for the
latest SDKs.
### Major Changes
* Updated to Java 11 and Ignition 8.1 SDK

  interval.
  * After module startup, the Ewon metadata is updated in the background at the configured interval.
  * Ewon metadata is now retrieved from the Ewon device directly, using M2Web API requests, instead of relying on the
    DataMailbox API.
