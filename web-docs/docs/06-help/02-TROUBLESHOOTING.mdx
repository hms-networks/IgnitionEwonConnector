# Ignition EwonÂ® Connector Module - Troubleshooting

### 1. Tags do not appear in Ignition

There are several reasons tags may not be populated into Ignition. Please follow the following steps in order.

1. Verify that all steps in the [Ewon Setup](#ewon-setup) section were followed.
2. If the system has just been configured, wait one hour for data to be registered in DataMailbox.
3. Verify your Talk2M credentials are correctly entered into the Ewon Connector settings in Ignition.
    * If your credentials were incorrectly entered, the Ignition logs will indicate a Authentication Error. Check the
      logs on the Ignition webserver by clicking `Status` > `Logs`. If your credentials are incorrect, you will see log
      entries in this format.

    * If you see this log error, check your Talk2M Account information entered on the `Ewon Connector` configuration
      page. _Note: Any changes done on this page require a restart of the connector module or Ignition. You can restart
      the module by navigating to `Config` > `Modules` and clicking `restart` next to the module._
4. If tag values are still not populated in Ignition, please contact [support](#support).

### 2. Changes on the Ewon Connector page do not take effect

Any changes done on this page require a restart of the connector module or Ignition. You can restart the module by
navigating to `Config` > `Modules` and clicking `restart` next to the module.
