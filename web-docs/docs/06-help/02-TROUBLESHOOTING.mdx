## 1. Tags do not appear in Ignition

### Symptom

All, or some, of the expected tags do not appear in Ignition.

### Cause

There are several reasons tags may not be populated into Ignition. The most common reasons are:

- The system has just been configured, and data has not yet been registered in DataMailbox.
- The Talk2M credentials are incorrectly entered into the Ewon Connector settings in Ignition.
- The Ewon Connector module is not running.

### Solution

To resolve this issue, try the following:

1. Ensure that the module has been installed and configured correctly.
    * For more information, please refer to the
      [Installation](../04-setup/02-INSTALLATION_UPGRADE.mdx) and [Configuration](../04-setup/03-CONFIGURATION.mdx)
      pages.
2. If the system has just been configured, wait for an upload interval (usually 1 hour) for data to be registered in
   DataMailbox.
3. Verify that the [configured credentials](../04-setup/03-CONFIGURATION.mdx) are correct.
    * The Ignition logs will indicate an Authentication Error if the credentials are incorrect.
      Check the logs on the Ignition webserver by clicking `Status` > `Logs`. If your credentials are incorrect, you
      will see log entries in this format.

    * If you see this log error, check your configured Talk2M Account information. For more information, please refer to
      the [Configuration](../04-setup/03-CONFIGURATION.mdx) page.

### 2. Changes on the Ewon Connector page do not take effect

### Symptom

Configuration changes made on the Ewon Connector page do not take effect or result in an error.

### Cause

<>The {ScDocusaurusConfig.title} may have not been restarted after configuration changes were made, which is preventing
the changes from taking effect, or in some cases, causing an error.
</><br/>

If the configuration is changed, the module must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
If the module is not restarted, the changes will not take effect, or may partially take effect, which can result in an
error.
