# Ignition EwonÂ® Connector Module - Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. How do I check my Talk2M data usage?

Your Talk2M data usage can be accessed
through [eCatcher](https://ewon.biz/cloud-services/talk2m/ecatcher "https://ewon.biz/cloud-services/talk2m/ecatcher").

1. Open eCatcher and login.
2. On the left hand menu bar click `Account`.
3. Once in the account properties click `Reports` near the top of the page.
4. From here you will be able to download the current or past monthly connection log reports.

### 2. If Ignition is not running will my data still be logged?

If Ignition is offline, data will still be logged by the Flexy and stored in DataMailbox. The amount of data points
stored in DataMailbox depends on
your [account type](https://ewon.biz/cloud-services/talk2m/plan-pricing "https://ewon.biz/cloud-services/talk2m/plan-pricing").
Once Ignition is online again, all logged points will be fetched from DataMailbox by Ignition.
