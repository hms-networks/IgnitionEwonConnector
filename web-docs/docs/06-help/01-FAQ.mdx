## 1. How can I check my Talk2M data usage?

Your Talk2M data usage can be checked through the [eCatcher](https://ewon.biz/cloud-services/talk2m/ecatcher) software.

1. Open eCatcher and log in to your Talk2M account.
2. Click the **Account** option in the left-hand menu.
3. In the **Account Properties** menu, click **Reports** near the top of the page.
4. In the **Reports** menu, you may download current or past monthly reports for your Talk2M account.

## 2. If Ignition is not running, will my data still be logged?

If Ignition is not running, or is offline, data will still be logged by the Flexy and stored in DataMailbox. Once
Ignition is running again, all logged historical data points will be fetched from DataMailbox by Ignition, unless the
device or tag is configured for realtime (live) data only.

:::note

The number of data points stored in DataMailbox is limited, and depends on the Talk2M account type. For information
about Talk2M account types, please refer to the [Talk2M Pricing](https://ewon.biz/cloud-services/talk2m/plan-pricing)
page.

## 3. Where can I find my tags in Ignition?

<AccessingTagsPartial/>

:::tip

If the module has just started up or loaded recently, it may take a few minutes for initial metadata to be cached before
tags will be available in Ignition.

## 4. What happened to the Ignition 7.9 version of this module?

The Ignition 7.9 version of this module is no longer being actively developed, maintained, or supported.
To access and learn more about the previous, Ignition 7.9 compatible version of this module, please see the
[Ignition 7.9 Branch (Ignition-7.9-main)](https://github.com/hms-networks/IgnitionEwonConnector/tree/Ignition-7.9-main).

## 5. Where did the 'Tag Names Contain Periods' setting go?

The 'Tag Names Contain Periods' setting has been removed from the module as of version 2.0.0.
Previously, this setting was used to determine whether the module should attempt to convert periods in tag names, which
are not valid in Ignition, to underscore(s) instead.

As of version 2.0.0, this functionality has been merged with the 'Disable Tag Name Checking' setting.
By default, the 'Disable Tag Name Checking' setting is disabled, which means that the module will attempt to convert
any illegal tag names to valid tag names by replacing illegal characters with underscores.
If you wish to disable this functionality, you may enable the 'Disable Tag Name Checking' setting.
