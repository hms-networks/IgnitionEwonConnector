## Libraries and Dependencies

<>The {ScDocusaurusConfig.title} comes pre-bundled with all of its required libraries and dependencies. When developing,
these libraries will automatically be downloaded and managed by the Maven build system.</><br/>

### Adding Libraries and Dependencies

As required, you can include additional libraries or dependencies using the Maven build system. To
include a new library or dependency, add a new `<dependency></dependency>` block in
the `<dependencies></dependencies>` section of your `pom.xml`. For example,

```xml

<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>commons-lang</groupId>
        <artifactId>commons-lang</artifactId>
        <version>2.6</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>
```

:::caution

<>Additional libraries or dependencies must support Java 11, and shall not conflict with Ignition, the&nbsp;
{ScDocusaurusConfig.title}, or its libraries and dependencies.</><br/>
